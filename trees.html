      <h2>What's a HashMap?</h2>
      <p class = "info">
        <img style= "float: left;" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9H11.png" alt="linked list">
        In order to place information into a hashmap, two pieces are needed - the information itself and a key.
        An example would be <strong> ("cat", 'c') </strong>. "Cat" is the information we want to store. The letter 'c' is our key.
        The key has to be passed to what's known as a <em>hash function</em>. All hash functions must return a single positive integer value, regardless of
        the key. This function has to be repeatable for the same key but different enough for similar keys. This integer represents the address of that piece of information.
        <br />
        For example, if our keys were words, two similar words should return different values. "cat" and "act" should not map to the same address.
        However, there's no guarantee that a key will map to an empty address. This is known as a <strong>collision</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Open Addressing</h2>
      <p class = "info">
        Collisions occur when two pieces of data map to the same address. In open addressing, the data will look for the next empty and available spot in the array.
        It will loop back around if it reaches the end of the array.
      </p>
      <h2>Chain Hashing</h2>
      <p class = "info">
      In chain hashing, two pieces of data with the same key will indeed get mapped to the same address.
      The difference here is that new data coming in will get appended to the list at that specific address.
      </p>

      <h2>Cuckoo Hashing</h2>
      <p class = "info">
        In this method, there can be 2 or more hash functions. It will use the first hash function for element lookup. In the case of a collision, it will use one of the other hash functions.
        If all hash functions are used and there is still a collision, then the key it collided with is removed to make space for the new key,
        and the old key is re-hashed with one of the other hash functions, which maps it to another address.
        If that location also results in a collision, then the process repeats until there is no collision or the process traverses all the buckets, at which point the table is resized.
