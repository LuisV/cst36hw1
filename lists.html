      <h2>What's a node?</h2>
      <img style ="margin-top: 10px; width: 100%;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GZQchlevd7c/T9xl7Sj12hI/AAAAAAAAAGs/c-Yj9YEb1TQ/s1600/linkedlist.png" alt="linked list">
      <p class = "info">
      A node is a specific data structure. It consists of two parts, the data itself, and the link to the next node.
      By chaining and pointing one node to the next, a programmer can create what's known as a linked list. This allows data to be arranged more freely than with a traditional array.
      <br/>
      Since everything is linked together, the linked list has constant inserting and deleting capablities - Links can be reassigned without needing to shift things over.
      However, lookup time is linear. You would need to traverse X number of nodes to get to the one you need.
      </p>

      <h2>What can you do with a node?</h2>
      <h2>Trees</h2>

        Nodes can be linked in such a way that it creates a structure that resembles tree branches. These trees can be either <strong>binary tress or binary search trees</strong>.
        In binary search trees, the left node if always smaller than the right. This does not apply in regular binary trees though. Traversal though a tree is normally done recursively.
        There are three ways established ways to "visit" each node: Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order.

      <h2>Heaps</h2>
      <p class= "info">
        Heaps are essetially trees with a very distinct specific rule. The nodes near the top, or the parent nodes, are always bigger than the child. This is known as a max heap.
        The reverse is true in a min heap. Heaps are especially useful
