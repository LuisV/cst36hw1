    <h2>Static Arrays</h2>

      You can think of an array as a set box with compartments for each item. Most languages have a sort of primitive array structure called a <strong>static array</strong>.
      The number of elements do not change from its initilzation.
      Because arrays are typically allocated at compile time, they cannot grow nor shrink in size and maintain a constant memory space.
      Array elements can be accessed by its index in constant time. This means that you can lookup the first element in the same time frame as the one thousandth element.

      <h2>Dynamic Arrays</h2>
      <p class = "info">
       These arrays function a bit differently. A pointer is initialized at compile time but the space is only allocated at run time.

       This means that a specific size is not required when creating the array. It also eliminates wasted space by adjusting to the number of elements.

    <h2>Vectors</h2>
    <p class = "info">
     Using dynamic arrays, programmers can create objects that make it easier for them to store and manipulate data.
     Vectors are essentially dynamic array objects with greatly enhanced functionality. They can push elements to front and back,
     allocate more memory for elements, and keep track or their own size.
